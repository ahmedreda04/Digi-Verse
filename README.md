# Digi-Verse
Digi-Verse?  This website tackles both binary calculations (add &amp; subtract) and conversions (binary, decimal, hex). Navigate &amp; conquer your digital world! 


I created this project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A user, first, enters the website to the main menu and they are, then, prompted to choose either use the calculator function that adds and subtracts binary digits or they can use the converter option; that allows the user to choose from converting from Binary to Decimal or Decimal to Binary or  Hexadecimal to Decimal or from Decimal to Hexadecimal.
